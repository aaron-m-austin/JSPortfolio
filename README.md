Oh hi there!

Welcome to my new and improved portfolio page!

This is a project that has multiple projects "hidden" inside to meet various requirements from the Code Louisville Web Development 2 course.

Inside you will find various Unsplash API calls to utilize randomized photos for various parts of the project. Within this project there is also a mobile weather app that utilizes a weather API. This is a mobile friendly website, with various accessibility utilizations.

The three seperate requirements fulfilled here are:

Visualizing Data in a user friendly way (Percentages displayed)

Retrieve data from a third party API and display items (utilized multiple times)

Implementing interactive features (Light/Dark mode, downloadable resume, various photos with animations)

This webpage will be hosted utilizing GitHub pages, however as we all know pages can take a few hours to update. So please be patient while the service is rendering my page!

Thank you, and happy coding!

(Note to QA: After speaking with my mentors regarding the project within a project idea, they deemed it appropriate based on the nature of my portfolio where many free API calls didn't make a ton of sense. So in a nutshell, there are several projects completed within one.)
